Alfvén wave instabilities driven by energetic particles are common in fusion devices. Understanding their behavior is essential for the good confinement of fusion plasma. For this purpose, a series of experiments are performed on EAST to investigate the excitation of toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes (TAEs). Experimentally, it was found that AEs with frequencies around 80, 134, 157 kHz are excited by ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) hydrogen minority heating scenario. Moreover, the excitation of AEs is independent of the wall-coating materials, but determined with the generation and confinement of the fast ions. Statistical analysis suggests that the TAEs can only be excited when the ICRH power is larger than 2 MW and the H98 factor is larger than 1.15. In line with the experiments, a set of simulations using TORIC, ASCOT, and NOVA-C is performed. The simulation results show that with the experimental density profile and safety factor, the measured TAE with frequency of 134 kHz is well reproduced by taking into account the plasma toroidal rotation frequency. However, the appearance of the 80 kHz mode cannot be captured in the simulations. The ICRH-generated fast hydrogen ions mainly have banana orbits and that their perpendicular velocity is much larger than that of the parallel ions. The stability analysis with NOVA-C suggests that the radial gradient of the fast H ion distribution is the only driving source of TAEs. For TAEs locate in the center of Alfvén continuum, the D ion Landau damping is the dominant damping term; For most other TAEs which have intersections with the continuum boundary, the continuum damping becomes the dominant damping mechanism.
