In magnetic confinement fusion plasmas, radio-frequency wave heating in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) and neutral beam injection (NBI) are two main heating methods. Their synergetic heating has long been a key topic in fusion research. In this work, we clarify the basic principles of ICRF high harmonic heating and the synergetic heating between ICRF and NBI. Then, we perform a series of experiments on EAST tokamak and carry out the corresponding TRANSP simulations. The results indicate that the ICRF-NBI synergetic heating not only significantly increases the plasma parameters (including poloidal beta, plasma stored energy, ion temperature and neutron yield), but also generates a large number of energetic particles and develops an energetic particle tail in its distribution function. For instance, the ICRF third harmonic heating with 1 MW of power can increase the energy of NBI fast ions from 60 to 600 keV. By changing the hydrogen minority concentration, improving the ICRF and NBI heating power, using the on-axis ICRF heating or optimizing the NBI injection angle, the ICRF-NBI synergetic heating effect can be further enhanced, accompanied with an increase of fast ion energy. Moreover, by using the fast ion distribution as input in the orbit tracing code, the transport and loss of energetic particles are calculated. The results show that the initial positions of the lost energetic particles are on the low field side, and their orbits are mainly trapped orbits. The loss of energetic particles is mainly located in the middle and upper plane of the main limiter, ICRF and LH antenna limiters. The lost of these energetic particles are considered as one of the main reasons why hot spots occur on the limiters.
