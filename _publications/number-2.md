Efficient ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) wave heating requires good wave coupling at the plasma edge and good radio frequency power absorption in the plasma core. This study reviews recent progress in improving these two aspects of ICRF heating with the new two-strap antennas through various experiments and simulations on the Experimental Advanced
Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). Our study shows that the ICRF coupling can be significantly improved by decreasing the parallel wave number, increasing the local scrape-off layer (SOL) density by midplane gas puffing, and increasing the global SOL density by decreasing the separatrix–antenna distance. It can also be improved by increasing the core plasma density, changing the divertor strike point position, and optimizing the antenna phasing.
The core ICRF power absorption can be increased by optimizing the cyclotron resonance position and minority ion concentration and by applying new heating schemes such as three-ion heating. Although some of the methods have been previously studied on other devices, improving ICRF coupling by shifting the divertor strike point was tested on EAST for the first time. Quantitative characterization of these methods and the conclusions drawn from this study can provide important insights for achieving more efficient ICRF heating in current and future fusion machines.
