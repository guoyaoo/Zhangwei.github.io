张伟，中国科学院等离子体物理研究所研究员、中国科学技术大学博士生导师，国家高层次引进人才。长期从事磁约束聚变微波加热理论与实验研究，曾先后在中国科学院等离子体物理研究所、比利时根特大学及德国马普等离子体物理研究所完成硕士、博士及博士后研究，并曾受聘于美国通用原子能公司，获永久职位。
主持多项重要科研项目，包括欧盟EUROfusion计划、ITER国际项目、国家磁约束核聚变能发展研究专项、中国科学院国际合作项目、国家优秀青年科学基金项目以及国家自然科学基金面上项目等。累计发表SCI论文133篇，学术成果显著。
屡获国际学术荣誉，包括欧洲物理学会博士研究奖（每年授予1–4人）、欧盟EUROfusion Researcher Grant（每年约10人）、亚太等离子体物理学会U40青年科学家奖（聚变领域每年1–2人），并当选为ITER Scientist Fellow、美国能源部基金评审专家及国际托卡马克物理活动组织（ITPA）专家等，展现了其在国际聚变领域的广泛影响力。
Zhang Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a doctoral supervisor at the University of Science and Technology of China, is a national high-level talent. He has long been engaged in experimental and theoretical research on microwave heating in magnetic confinement fusion. He completed his master's, doctoral, and postdoctoral studies at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ghent University in Belgium, and the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, respectively. He was also offered a permanent position at General Atomics in the United States.\n
He has led several key scientific research projects, including the EUROfusion program of the European Union, the ITER international project, the National Magnetic Confinement Nuclear Fusion Energy Development Research Program, the International Cooperation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars, and the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. He has published a total of 133 SCI papers, demonstrating significant academic achievements.\n
Researcher Zhang Wei has received numerous international academic honors, including the European Physical Society Doctoral Research Award (awarded to 1–4 individuals annually), the EUROfusion Researcher Grant (approximately 10 recipients per year), and the Asia-Pacific Plasma Physics Association U40 Young Scientist Award (1–2 individuals in the fusion field annually). He has also been appointed as an ITER Scientist Fellow, a reviewer for the U.S. Department of Energy's funding programs, and an expert in the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA), highlighting his extensive influence in the international fusion research community.
